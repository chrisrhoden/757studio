    Software development happens in your head; not in an editor, IDE, or design tool. 
    We're well educated on how to work with software and hardware, but what about 
    wetware â€“ our own brains?

  %p
    Join Andy Hunt for a look at how the brain really works and how to think differently 
    about thinking. You'll get a brief recap of the Dreyfus Model (from his popular talk 
    "Herding Racehorses and Racing Sheep") and explore practical learning techniques 
    including mind maps, reading techniques, and situational feedback. We'll also examine 
    how to best cope with the literal torrent of new information that assaults each of us, 
    using methods ranging from the tried-and-true to the truly exotic.

  %h3 Clinton R. Nixon
  %h4 Development Director at Viget Labs

  %p
    Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, has summed up Ruby's
    philosophy as "Ruby is designed to make programmers happy." How can
    that happiness cut your development time, reduce your defects, and
    work closer with your customers?

  %p
    In this talk, Clinton will cover both the Ruby language and the
    community of developers behind it. He will walk through an introduction to the
    Ruby programming language and then show how the common values of the
    Ruby community tie in with the values of agile development. You will learn
    why the team at 
    = link_to 'Viget', 'http://www.viget.com/'
    chose Ruby as their development platform and
    why you might want to consider doing the same.

  %h3 Jamie Pinkham
  %h4 Software Engineer at Mobelux

  %p
    Are you interested in knowing what you will have to learn to build the next 
    big iPhone application? Apple's Objective-C programming language is the 
    building block for all of its APIs, including Cocoa, Apple's name for 
    the collection of frameworks and accompanying runtimes that make up the 
    development layer of Mac OS X and iPhone.
    
  %p 
    Jamie will cover the development tools, programming paradigms and limitations of 
    iPhone development (including the Cocoa Touch API and the Objective-C programming language) 
    at a very abstract level. He will also reveal the mystery of the Objective-C's bracket syntax.
