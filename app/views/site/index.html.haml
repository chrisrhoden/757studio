  %h4 Development Directory at Viget Labs

  %p
    Yukihiro Matsumoto, the creator of Ruby, has summed up Ruby's
    philosophy as "Ruby is designed to make programmers happy." How can
    that happiness cut your development time, reduce your defects, and
    work closer with your customers?

  %p
    In this talk, Clinton will cover both the Ruby language and the
    community of developers behind it. He will walk through an introduction to the
    Ruby programming language and then show how the common values of the
    Ruby community tie in with the values of agile development. You will learn
    why the team at 
    = link_to 'Viget', 'http://www.viget.com/'
    chose Ruby as their development platform, and
    why you might want to consider doing the same.

  %h4 Software Engineer at Mobelux

  %p
    Are you interested in knowing what you will have to learn to built the next 
    big iPhone application? Apple's Objective-C programming language is the 
    building block for all of its API's, including Cocoa, Apple's name for 
    the collection of frameworks and accompanying runtimes that make up the 
    development layer of Mac OS X and iPhone.
    
  %p 
    Jamie will cover the development tools, programming paradigms and limitations of 
    iPhone development (including the Cocoa Touch API and the Objective-C programming language) 
    at very abstract level. He will also reveal the mystery of the Objective-C's bracket syntax.
